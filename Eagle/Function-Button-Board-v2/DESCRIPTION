Button board version 1 with some revisions (removed drill holes, added indent holes for switch, a small routing error).
Header pins soldered to bottom of board (requires changing).
Working, but could be improved with the following:
- header pins: solder onto top side
- bigger pads where possible
- increase physical stability by adding more pin headers on each side (e.g. ground them)
- refine x position of buttons
- consider two header pin lines above and below buttons
